# Signal > Noise -

Ai can do in a minute what the human brain will never be able to do in a lifetime. All the so called tech influencers who try to knock ai and make click bait videos that just make you stupider (prime/theo vids for example) are noise, not the signal. You see, in life you want to focus on the signal, not the noise. 





# Rust is god. -

From web dev to anything, Rust is objectively superior. Ai will one day poop out a superior lang for sure, but for now the combo of Ai and the ultra strict Rust compiler produces superior code. It is like 2 experts working together to produce superior code.

# Do you play call of duty all day? -
