# What tech has become-

Tech has become a bunch of delusional influencers trying to convince the world that they are so great...when in reality Ai can do in a minute what they will never be able to do in a lifetime. 



# Best lang-

From web dev to anything, Rust is objectively superior. Ai will poop out a superior lang for sure, but for now the combo of Ai and the ultra strict Rust compiler produces  superior code. Any lang that compiles junk code without halting is profoundly inferior. The combo of ai and the rust compiler work together and give you an awesome app...even if you do not know a thing about coding !!!
