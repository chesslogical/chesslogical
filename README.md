# Signal > Noise -

Ai can do in a minute what the human brain will never be able to do in a lifetime. All the so called tech influencers who try to knock ai and make click bait videos that just make you stupider (prime/theo vids for example) are noise, not the signal. You see, in life you want to focus on the signal, not the noise.

# Do you play call of duty all day? -
